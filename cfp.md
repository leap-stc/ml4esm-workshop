# Call for papers

We are currently accepting submissions of short papers investigating machine learning techniques with the potential to advance earth system modelling. Topics include but are not limited to:

- hybrid physics-ML climate modelling
- full model emulation for weather and climate
- differentiable climate modelling
- dynamical downscaling
- uncertainty quantification
- anomaly detection
- parameter estimation for climate models

# Submission requirements

We welcome papers for up to **4 pages** in length, excluding reference and supplementary materials. See information on [Author Instructions](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorInstructions), [LaTeX style files](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2024/Styles/icml2024.zip) and an [Example Paper](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2023/Styles/example_paper.pdf). Submissions must clearly articulate applications relevant to earth system modelling. Accepted papers will be invited to give poster presentations, and a total of six will be invited to give spotlight talks. 

# Review Process

The review process for this workshop is double-blind, and we are accumulating a pool of reviewers with relevant expertise.
