# Workshop summary

Long-term climate projections emphatically agree that we are headed for a warming world. However, much uncertainty remains in the expected magnitude of warming, the change in precipitation patterns, and the frequency of climate extremes. This uncertainty undermines the ability of policymakers and economic decision-makers to build consensus around measures for mitigating and adapting to a potentially irreversible, multi-trillion-dollar problem. Although improved understanding of physics has been essential to climate model improvement, reducing remaining uncertainty will require overcoming the increased computational expense of explicitly representing these physics at sub-resolution scales. Machine learning (ML) methods could provide tools for emulating subgrid climate processes at operationally viable costs. However, engaging the machine learning community on this task has been inhibited by high barriers of entry due to a lack of well-documented training data and relevant, easy-to-use workflows. [ClimSim](https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim/), a large multi-scale dataset for hybrid physics-ML climate emulation recently accepted for the Neurips 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track, was our first step toward filling this gap. The first part of the workshop features peer-reviewed contributions based on the ClimSim data set as part of a public challenge that we will organize before the workshop. The workshop's second part will feature experts' presentations on several frontiers of earth system modeling where machine learning is driving progress. It aims to cover methodological advances and open challenges that are fundamental for a wide range of disciplines relevant to improving climate predictability.

# Anticipated audience size:

400

# Plan to get an audience for a workshop (advertising, reaching out, etc.):

We plan to advertise via social media channels (Twitter/Mastodon/BlueSky, LinkedIn, etc.), the Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP) NSF Science and Technology Center, the Multiscale Machine Learning in Coupled Earth System Modeling (M2LiNES), the Frontier Development Lab, the Berkeley AI Research Climate Initiative, the Climate Change AI community platform, and internal channels at universities with high representation of under-represented minorities in STEM. 

# Diversity Commitment:

We aimed to achieve diversity in various aspects when we selected speakers, panelists, and organizers. Our speakers, panelists, and organizers are a mix of domain scientists in earth sciences and machine learning experts representing diverse backgrounds, nationalities, and locations. They have different levels of seniority in academia and industry, and they balance their expertise and interest in theory and applied machine learning. This will ensure a lively and balanced panel discussion.

# Access:

To maximize engagement and access, we will be pursuing a hybrid format. Talks will be streamed and recorded on YouTube, and accepted papers and posters will be uploaded online. All invited speakers will attend in person, but, to improve accessibility for junior researchers, those presenting accepted contributed talks and posters will have the option to present virtually. Workshop organizers will take questions from an online Q&A for the panel discussion. When assessing submissions, workshop organizers belonging to the same institution as that of the submitter(s) will not be involved in assessment. If necessary, speakers/panelists will be asked to volunteer to assist in assessment.

This workshop distinguishes itself from previous workshops by orienting itself around a public competition meant to draw in machine learning experts on a well-defined, long-standing climate science problem using a dataset and paper accepted in the 2023 Neurips Datasets and Benchmarks track. This serves as a foothold for machine learning experts to help drive progress in other open problems in earth system modeling. We also intentionally invited experts at the direct intersection of physics (turbulent flow, molecular dynamics, etc.) and machine learning to provide fundamental, first-principles insight into the challenges of generalizing data-driven
